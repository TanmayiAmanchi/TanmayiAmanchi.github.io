# Here are some plots
today we're making interactive plots in plotly. we'll make examples using the NYC aurbnb dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)

```

Do some initial data cleaning/subsetting
```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) |>
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) |>
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```
